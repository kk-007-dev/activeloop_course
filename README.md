LangChain &amp; Vector Databases in Production Course Hands on


Modules Covered
This course has been structured into several modules, each providing a detailed examination in increasing complexity of various facets of Large Language Models (LLMs), LangChain, and Deep Lake. Here is an overview of the modules you'll engage with.

1. From Zero to Hero
This introductory module serves as a quick guide, swiftly bringing you up to speed with all the fundamental concepts. It includes hands-on code snippets covering library installation, OpenAI credentials, deriving predictions from LLMs, and more. You'll also take a peek at Deep Lake and its applications.

2. Large Language Models and LangChain
This module provides a comprehensive overview of Large Language Models, including their capabilities, limitations, and use cases. You'll dive deep into LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4, explore these models' emergent abilities and scaling laws, and gain insights into phenomena like hallucinations and bias. This module also introduces LangChain and its role in integrating LLMs with other data sources and tools. You will also undertake a project to build a News Articles Summarizer.

3. Learning How to Prompt
Learning how to craft effective prompts is a key skill in working with LLMs. This module delves into the nuances of prompt engineering and teaches you to develop prompts that are easy to maintain. You'll learn techniques such as role prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain of thought. Towards the end of this module, you'll take your learning further by enhancing the News Articles Summarizer built in the previous module and undertaking a project to extract a knowledge graph from news articles.

4. Keeping Knowledge Organized with Indexes
The final module focuses on how to effectively leverage documents as a base for LLMs using LangChain's indexes and retrievers. You'll learn about data ingestion through various loaders, the importance of text splitters, and delve into the concept of embeddings and vector stores. The module ends with a project where you'll build a Customer Support Question Answering Chatbot using ChatGPT, Deep Lake, and LangChain.

5. Combining Components Together with Chains
In this module, you will get a handle on LangChain's chains - a concept that enables the creation of a single, coherent application. You will understand why chains are used and have the opportunity to work on multiple projects. These include creating a YouTube Video Summarizer, building a Jarvis for your Knowledge Base, and exploring code understanding with GPT-4 and LangChain. You will also learn about the Self-Critique Chain and how to guard against undesirable outputs.

6. Giving Memory to LLMs
This module emphasizes the importance of memory in maintaining context over a conversation. You will master the different types of memory in LangChain, including ConversationBufferMemory, ConversationBufferWindowMemory, ConversationSummaryMemory, and ConversationChain. Various exciting projects await you, such as creating a chatbot that interacts with a Github Repo, building a question-answering chatbot, and working with financial data.

7. Making LLMs Interact with the World Using Tools
In this module, you'll explore LangChain's tools and their diverse applications, including Google Search, requests, Python REPL, Wikipedia, and Wolfram-Alpha. Projects in this module revolve around enhancing blog posts with LangChain and Google Search, recreating the Bing chatbot, and leveraging multiple tools simultaneously. You'll also learn how to define custom tools for your specific needs.

8. Using Language Model as Reasoning Engines with Agents
The final module introduces you to the concept of agents in LangChain, with a particular emphasis on using a language model as a reasoning engine. You'll explore autonomous agents, their projects, and the application of AutoGPT with LangChain. The module culminates with a project on building autonomous agents to create comprehensive analysis reports.


Each module has been thoughtfully designed to provide you with a solid understanding of LLMs, LangChain, and Deep Lake. By the end of this course, you'll have a firm grasp of these advanced tools and frameworks, ready to harness their potential to solve real-world problems.
